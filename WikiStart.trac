OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to read whole-slide images (also known as virtual slides). The current version is 2.3.1, released 2009-12-14. There is also a Java binding available, including a simple image viewer.

[wiki:Download]

== About OpenSlide ==

The library can read virtual slides in the following formats:

 * [wiki:"Trestle format" Trestle (.tif)]
 * [wiki:"Hamamatsu format" Hamamatsu (.vms)]
 * [wiki:"Aperio format" Aperio (.svs, .tif)]
 * [wiki:"MIRAX format" MIRAX (.mrxs)]
 * [wiki:"Generic tiled TIFF format" Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)]

It provides a simple C interface for programmers to use to decode images of these kinds.

See [wiki:"Supported Virtual Slide Formats"] for more information.

OpenSlide is a product of the research group of [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/ M. Satyanarayanan] (Satya) in the Carnegie Mellon [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ School of Computer Science].

== Tech Report ==

The architecture and design of the library is described in a technical report:

== About whole-slide images ==

Whole-slide images, also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution images used in digital
pathology. Reading these images using standard image tools or libraries is a challenge because
these tools are typically designed for images that can comfortably be uncompressed into RAM or
a swap file. Whole-slide images routinely exceed RAM sizes, often occupying tens of gigabytes
when uncompressed. Additionally, whole-slide images are typically multi-resolution, and only a
small amount of image data might be needed at a particular resolution.

There is no universal data format for whole-slide images, so each vendor implements its own
formats, libraries, and viewers. Vendors typically do not document their formats. Even when
there is documentation, important details are omitted. Because a vendorâ€™s library or viewer is the
only way to view a particular whole-slide image, doctors and researchers can be unnecessarily
tied to a particular vendor. Finally, few (if any) vendors provide libraries and viewers for non-Windows platforms. Some have gone with a server approach, pushing tiles through a web server,
or using Java applets, but these approaches have shortcomings in high-latency or non-networked
environments.
