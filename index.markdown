Version 3.2.2 has been released, adding support for negative coordinates and zero-sized dimensions in openslide_read_region, fixing a Windows build bug with new NGR support, and adding untested BigTIFF support.

= OpenSlide version 3.2.1, 2010-06-03 =
Version 3.2.1 has been released, fixing Windows crashes, quieting down the error logging, and fixing problems with libjpeg 7.

Version 0.9.0 of the Java bindings adds support for the error handling system, eliminates the swig dependency, and adds new methods for painting.

= OpenSlide version 3.2.0, 2010-06-01 =
Version 3.2.0 has been released, adding experimental CMake support and fixes for building with MSVC, an error handling mechanism, initial Hamamatsu Nanozoomer VMU support, and the "openslide-write-png" tool.

= OpenSlide version 3.1.1, 2010-04-27 =
Version 3.1.1 has been released, fixing some bugs reading invalid VMS files. VMS files with multiple layers (NoLayers > 1) are also supported now, but the additional layers are ignored.

= OpenSlide version 3.1.0, 2010-04-01 =
Version 3.1.0 has been released, which fixes problems with some TIFF files and adds support for certain newer Aperio files (compression 33005).

= OpenSlide version 3.0.3, 2010-03-01 =
Version 3.0.3 has been released, which fixes nasty artifacts in some MIRAX files seen at some zoom levels.

= OpenSlide version 3.0.2, 2010-02-17 =
Version 3.0.2 has been released, which restores the ability to build with glib 2.12, at the expense of not having "quickhash-1" in that configuration.

= OpenSlide version 3.0.1, 2010-02-04 =
Version 3.0.1 has been released, with a fix for drawing the edges of TIFF files.

= OpenSlide Java version 0.8.0, 2010-01-28 =
Version 0.8.0 of the Java bindings changes the license to LGPLv2, fixes some bugs, adds a new selection type, and adds a call to paint a specific layer without scaling.

= OpenSlide version 3.0.0, 2010-01-28 =
Version 3.0.0 has been released, with a license change to LGPLv2, introduction of "quickhash-1", MIRAX bug fixes, and documentation improvements.

OpenSlide
=========

OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to read
whole-slide images (also known as virtual slides). The current version
is 3.2.2, released 2010-06-16. There is also a Java binding available,
including a simple image viewer.

About OpenSlide
---------------

The library can read virtual slides in the following formats:

 * [Trestle (.tif)][2]
 * [Hamamatsu (.vms, .vmu)][3]
 * [Aperio (.svs, .tif)][4]
 * [MIRAX (.mrxs)][5]
 * [Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)][6]

[2]: Trestle%20format
[3]: Hamamatsu%20format
[4]: Aperio%20format
[5]: MIRAX%20format
[6]: Generic%20tiled%20TIFF%20format

It provides a simple C interface for programmers to use to decode
images of these kinds.

About whole-slide images
------------------------

Whole-slide images, also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution images used in digital
pathology. Reading these images using standard image tools or libraries is a challenge because
these tools are typically designed for images that can comfortably be uncompressed into RAM or
a swap file. Whole-slide images routinely exceed RAM sizes, often occupying tens of gigabytes
when uncompressed. Additionally, whole-slide images are typically multi-resolution, and only a
small amount of image data might be needed at a particular resolution.

There is no universal data format for whole-slide images, so each vendor implements its own
formats, libraries, and viewers. Vendors typically do not document their formats. Even when
there is documentation, important details are omitted. Because a vendorâ€™s library or viewer is the
only way to view a particular whole-slide image, doctors and researchers can be unnecessarily
tied to a particular vendor. Finally, few (if any) vendors provide libraries and viewers for non-Windows platforms. Some have gone with a server approach, pushing tiles through a web server,
or using Java applets, but these approaches have shortcomings in high-latency or non-networked
environments.
