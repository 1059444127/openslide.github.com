OpenSlide
=========

OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to read
whole-slide images (also known as virtual slides). The current version
is 3.2.2, released 2010-06-16. There is also a Java binding available,
including a simple image viewer.

About OpenSlide
---------------

The library can read virtual slides in the following formats:

 * [Trestle (.tif)][2]
 * [Hamamatsu (.vms, .vmu)][3]
 * [Aperio (.svs, .tif)][4]
 * [MIRAX (.mrxs)][5]
 * [Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)][6]

[2]: Trestle%20format
[3]: Hamamatsu%20format
[4]: Aperio%20format
[5]: MIRAX%20format
[6]: Generic%20tiled%20TIFF%20format

It provides a simple C interface for programmers to use to decode
images of these kinds.

See [Supported Virtual Slide Formats][7] for more information.

OpenSlide is a product of the research group of [M. Satyanarayanan][8]
(Satya) in the Carnegie Mellon [School of Computer Science][9].

About whole-slide images
------------------------

Whole-slide images, also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution images used in digital
pathology. Reading these images using standard image tools or libraries is a challenge because
these tools are typically designed for images that can comfortably be uncompressed into RAM or
a swap file. Whole-slide images routinely exceed RAM sizes, often occupying tens of gigabytes
when uncompressed. Additionally, whole-slide images are typically multi-resolution, and only a
small amount of image data might be needed at a particular resolution.

There is no universal data format for whole-slide images, so each vendor implements its own
formats, libraries, and viewers. Vendors typically do not document their formats. Even when
there is documentation, important details are omitted. Because a vendorâ€™s library or viewer is the
only way to view a particular whole-slide image, doctors and researchers can be unnecessarily
tied to a particular vendor. Finally, few (if any) vendors provide libraries and viewers for non-Windows platforms. Some have gone with a server approach, pushing tiles through a web server,
or using Java applets, but these approaches have shortcomings in high-latency or non-networked
environments.
